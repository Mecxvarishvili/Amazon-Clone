# Amazon Clone

The Amazon Clone website, a full-stack web application built with the latest and greatest technologies to replicate the features of the original Amazon website. Our website includes multiple pages to provide a seamless experience for users: Home Page, Search Page, Single Product Page, Sign-In Page, Sign-Up Page, Cart Page, and Profile Page.

Home page features a clean and intuitive layout that displays top product categories and featured items. Users can easily navigate to the search page by clicking on the search bar or selecting a category of their choice. The search page allows users to browse through products by using the search bar and filtering products based on their categories. The single product page is designed to provide detailed information about each product and allow users to add the item to their cart.

I utilized popular frameworks to build this website, including React, Redux, React Router, Formik, Sass, and Express.js. React provided the foundation for building reusable components and user interfaces, while Redux helped us manage the application's state. React Router allowed us to create dynamic routing for our different pages, and Formik helped us simplify form handling. Website's styling was made possible through the use of Sass, a CSS preprocessor. Lastly, Express.js provided the necessary backend support for our application.
